## Accessing community documents

In order to foster real time collaboration there are many working documents
and notes that are taken in Google Docs, and then transferred to this repository
if appropriate. 

To access these documents, you must _subscribe to the mailing list_
as outlined above, as these documents are shared automatically with anyone who
subscribes to that list. 

## Meetup

If you have a topic you'd like to present or would like to see discussed,
please propose it on the agenda for the meetup.
