# Accra Golang Meetup

Welcome to the Accra Golang Meetup community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the community - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.
Most of the docs are incomplete so please feel free to file an issue against this project for missing docs.
The docs here and in many places are based on content from the [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community).

## Communicating

The [communication](communication/) page lists communication channels like chat,
issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

## Governance

We are a nascent community so we do not have a proper governance model yet. Watch this space for changes as time goes by.

## Learn to Build

Links in [contributors/devel/README.md](contributors/devel/README.md)
lead to many relevant technical topics.

## Contribute

A first step to contributing is to pick from the list of projects (when they become available).
Start attending meetups, join the slack channel and subscribe to the mailing list.
Projects will often have a set of "help wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide](contributors/guide/README.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:
1. How to [file an issue]
1. How to [find something to work on]
1. How to [open a pull request]

## Membership

We encourage all contributors to become members. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners.
Learn more about requirements and responsibilities of membership in our [Community Membership] page.
